This project served as a 'one-stop' shop for regeneration news across the UK. Following on from the Grenfell Tower disaster it became imperative to collate and analyse regeneration news to help prevent a similar loss of life from ever occuring again. 

The website is primarily served through HTML, Javascript and PHP. A Corpus analysis tool was created through Python to analyse any potential regeneration data that was coming out of the UK government API.
